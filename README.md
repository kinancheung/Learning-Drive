<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

Learning Drive is a social media platform that allows for users to post about the content they have learned. Users can then also react to and comment on peoples post adding their own opinions. The user can see posts from three sources. From the global feed, Activity feed, and directly on a users profile. Each user has a profile that can be followed, showing their information, statistics and post history.

<h2 id="run">Running the Project</h2>

To run the project, Clone the repository, then `cd` into the root of the repository

```sh
> git clone git@github.com:UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2022/project-group-zesty-zuchons.git

> cd ./project-group-zesty-zuchons

```

Ensure that the environment files have been placed within the `backend` folder (`.env` and `service-account.json`). These have been provided by email.

### Running the Backend

```sh
# Navigate to the backend directory
> cd backend

# Install dependencies
> yarn

# Start the server
> yarn start
```

The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000

### Running the Frontend

```sh
# Navigate to the frontend directory
> cd frontend

# Install dependencies
> yarn

# Start the app
> yarn start
```

You should now be able to view the app at http://localhost:3000 in the browser

<h2 id="testing">Running the Tests</h2>
  
### Backend
The backend has a full test suite on Postman which covers all endpoints with various edge cases and scenarios. To run / view this test suite properly, you must have Postman installed.

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. [ Import ](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/) the Postman tests located at `learning-drive/backend/backend-tests.postman_collection.json` in the repository
3. Run script to get auth token for running tests:
   - from backend directory:
   - run `npm run token -- 6SZoYTBzY6ewF5Rkko7hi1QMF8C3`
   - This will generate a JWT which then must be used as an [ environment variable ](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) within Postman
   - Inside of the collection in Postman, there is an eye icon.
   - Select this icon and paste the generated auth token into the `CURRENT VALUE` text field for the variable `token`.
4. Before running the tests it is important to re-seed the database, otherwise some of the tests may fail:
   - run `npx prisma db seed` from within the backend directory.
     - IMPORTANT: This will reset the database back to a very minimal number of posts, so please use it sparingly or not at all.
5. Start the backend by following the instructions in the `Running the Project` section of this document
6. Then inside the collection `backend-test` in Postman, select run `Run collection` option, and run all tests.

### Frontend

The frontend has a test suite of unit tests written in jest.

From the `frontend` directory, run `yarn test`. This will start the test runner in "watch" mode, and tests will rerun when files are changed.

<h2 id="storybook">Storybook</h2>

The frontend uses storybook to create a library of components used in the application. To view it, run `yarn storybook` from within the frontend directory. This should start storybook at http://localhost:6006

<h2 id="api">API Specification</h2>

The specification for our Rest API is defined according to the OpenAPI Specification in [spec.yaml](https://github.com/UOA-CS732-SE750-Students-2022/project-group-zesty-zuchons/blob/main/spec.yaml/).
